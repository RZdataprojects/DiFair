2. Listen actively: ""I'm here to listen and support you. Can you share more about what's going on and how you're feeling?""
3. Avoid making assumptions: ""I'm not sure why you're not cooperating with your family members. Can you tell me more about your perspective and what you need from them?""
4. Offer support: ""I'm here to support you. Is there anything I can do to help you feel more comfortable and supported?""

Remember, everyone's experiences and emotions are unique, and it's important to approach each situation with empathy and respect.","I understand that you are looking for possible causes of a person's anger and uncooperative behavior towards their family members.
